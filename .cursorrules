  6. ContactInfo (property contact)
  7. ContactMessage (inquiries)
- Schema: `apps/api/prisma/schema.prisma`
- ERD Generation: `npx prisma-uml ./prisma/schema.prisma --output svg --file ./prisma/ERD.svg`

**Tech Stack**:
- Frontend:
  - React + TypeScript
  - Tailwind CSS (with dark mode support)
  - React Router
  - TanStack Query
  - Zod for validation

- Backend:
  - Node.js + TypeScript
  - Express
  - Prisma ORM
  - SQLite/MongoDB
  - JWT Authentication

**Key Features**:

pnpm install    # Install dependencies
pnpm dev        # Start development servers
```

This appears to be a professional real estate website project with a strong focus on type safety, component reusability, and modern development practices. The monorepo structure allows for good code organization and sharing of common components and types across different parts of the application.
