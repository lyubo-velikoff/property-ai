- Edit property edit is not really working. Produces an error below. Can you investigate and fix it.

{
    "status": "error",
    "message": "Invalid input data",
    "code": "VALIDATION_ERROR",
    "errors": {
        "type": [
            "Invalid enum value. Expected 'APARTMENT' | 'HOUSE' | 'VILLA' | 'OFFICE' | 'SHOP' | 'WAREHOUSE' | 'LAND', received 'COMMERCIAL'"
        ],
        "contact_info": [
            "Expected object, received string"
        ]
    }
}


- So we have the CRUD operations in the admin panel. Would be nice whenever we do a create, edit, delete operation to have a toast message to inform the user of the operation status. Act as a designer and developer and produce a great toast notification. Alternatively you can install a third package library for that I don't mind it. The goal is to have the application look responsive and if there is a success, we want to see that message being displayed and whenever there is an error want to be notified about it.
