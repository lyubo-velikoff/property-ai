- Improve pagination across the app. Have it as a shared component so might need to create a shared library package for it. Can you also make it so that whenever we go to the next page, the previous page is not being lost. Check if there are any broken unit tests after u come with a good pagination and if there is no tests, add some. We have existing unit tests across the aps/web.


- Edit property is not really working. Produces an error below. Can you investigate and fix it.

{
    "status": "error",
    "message": "Invalid input data",
    "code": "VALIDATION_ERROR",
    "errors": {
        "type": [
            "Invalid enum value. Expected 'APARTMENT' | 'HOUSE' | 'VILLA' | 'OFFICE' | 'SHOP' | 'WAREHOUSE' | 'LAND', received 'COMMERCIAL'"
        ],
        "contact_info": [
            "Expected object, received string"
        ]
    }
}


- So we have the CRUD operations in the admin panel. Would be nice whenever we do a create, edit, delete operation to have a toast message to inform the user of the operation status. Act as a designer and developer and produce a great toast notification. Alternatively you can install a third package library for that I don't mind it. The goal is to have the application look responsive and if there is a success, we want to see that message being displayed and whenever there is an error want to be notified about it.
