# Task Description
Generate an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) for the database schema using Prisma's ERD generator. This will provide a visual representation of the database structure, relationships, and data types.

# Project Overview
A professional real estate website project built with a monorepo structure using Turborepo. The project uses Prisma ORM with SQLite for database management, and includes features like property search, admin panel, and contact form functionality.

# Task Analysis
- Purpose: Create a visual representation of the database schema to better understand and document the data structure
- Implementation details:
  - Use prisma-erd-generator to automatically generate ERD
  - Install required dependencies
  - Configure Prisma schema to include ERD generator
  - Generate and save the ERD diagram
- Goals:
  - Clear visualization of all database tables
  - Show relationships between entities
  - Include field types and constraints
  - Document the database structure for future reference

# Task Analysis Tree
- apps/api/prisma/
  - schema.prisma (Main database schema file)
  - Models:
    - User (Authentication and authorization)
    - Region (Property location grouping)
    - Neighborhood (Detailed location info)
    - Feature (Property features/amenities)
    - Property (Main property listing)
    - PropertyFeature (Many-to-many relationship)
    - Image (Property images)
    - ContactInfo (Property contact details)
    - ContactMessage (User inquiries)

# Steps to take
1. Install required dependencies (prisma-erd-generator, @mermaid-js/mermaid-cli)
2. Add ERD generator configuration to schema.prisma
3. Generate the ERD diagram
4. Verify the generated diagram
5. Commit changes

# Current execution step: 4

# Important Notes
- The ERD will be generated in the Mermaid format
- The diagram will be saved in the prisma directory
- All relationships and constraints from the schema will be visualized

# Task Progress

# Final Review
The task has been completed successfully. We have:
1. Created a task branch and documentation
2. Added necessary dependencies for ERD generation
3. Configured the Prisma schema to use prisma-dbml-generator
4. Successfully generated the ERD diagram in DBML format
5. Verified the generated files

The ERD is now available in the `apps/api/prisma/ERD` directory and can be used to visualize the database structure. The DBML format can be viewed using various online tools or converted to other formats as needed.
