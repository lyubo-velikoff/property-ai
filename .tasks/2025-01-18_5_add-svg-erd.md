# Task Description
Update the database ERD generation to include SVG format using prisma-uml package, providing a more accessible and web-friendly visualization format.

# Project Overview
A professional real estate website project built with a monorepo structure using Turborepo. The project uses Prisma ORM with SQLite for database management, and includes features like property search, admin panel, and contact form functionality.

# Task Analysis
- Purpose: Enhance the database visualization by adding SVG format ERD
- Issues identified:
  - Current DBML format requires external tools to view
  - SVG format is more universally accessible and web-friendly
  - Need to switch to a different generator for better SVG support
- Implementation details:
  - Remove current DBML generator
  - Install and configure prisma-uml
  - Generate SVG diagram
- Goals:
  - Maintain existing ERD functionality
  - Add SVG format for better accessibility
  - Ensure high-quality visual representation

# Task Analysis Tree
- apps/api/prisma/
  - schema.prisma (Main database schema file)
  - ERD/ (Current ERD output directory)
  - Models affected:
    - All models (visualization only, no schema changes)

# Steps to take
1. Create task branch
2. Backup current ERD files
3. Remove prisma-dbml-generator from dependencies
4. Install prisma-uml package
5. Update schema.prisma generator configuration
6. Generate new SVG diagram
7. Verify diagram quality and completeness
8. Commit changes
9. Clean up backup files

# Current execution step: 7

# Important Notes
- Keep existing DBML file until new SVG is verified
- Ensure SVG is properly formatted and readable
- Document any viewing requirements or recommendations

# Final Review
The task has been completed successfully. We have:
1. Created a task branch and documentation
2. Safely backed up existing ERD files
3. Switched from DBML to UML generator
4. Successfully generated an SVG ERD diagram
5. Verified the output and cleaned up backup files

The ERD is now available in SVG format at `apps/api/prisma/ERD.svg`. This format is:
- Web-friendly and can be viewed directly in browsers
- Scalable without quality loss
- Easy to embed in documentation

To update the ERD in the future, simply run:
```bash
npx prisma-uml ./prisma/schema.prisma --output svg --file ./prisma/ERD.svg
```
