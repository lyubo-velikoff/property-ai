# Task Description
Add a root-level pnpm test command to run all tests across apps and packages in one go, and remove any unnecessary watch flags from existing test commands.

# Project Overview
A professional real estate website project built with a monorepo structure using Turborepo. The project uses Prisma ORM with SQLite for database management, and includes features like property search, admin panel, and contact form functionality.

# Task Analysis
- Purpose: Streamline testing workflow by adding a root-level test command
- Issues identified:
  - No root-level test command exists
  - Some packages have watch mode enabled by default
  - Inconsistent test script naming across packages
- Implementation details:
  - Add test script to root package.json using Turborepo
  - Remove watch flags from package test scripts
  - Ensure all packages have proper test commands
- Goals:
  - Single command to run all tests
  - Consistent test behavior across packages
  - No automatic watch mode

# Task Analysis Tree
- Root
  - package.json (needs test script added)
- Apps
  - api/
    - package.json (has test script)
    - Uses Jest
  - web/
    - package.json (has test script with vitest)
    - Uses Vitest
- Packages
  - shared-ui/
    - package.json (has test and test:watch scripts)
    - Uses Vitest
  - shared-types/
    - package.json (no test script needed - types only)

# Steps to take
1. Create backup of package.json files
2. Update shared-ui test script to remove watch mode
3. Update web app test script to remove watch mode
4. Add root-level test script using Turborepo
5. Test the changes
6. Clean up backups

# Current execution step: 5

# Important Notes
- shared-types package doesn't need tests (type definitions only)
- API tests already run without watch mode
- Web and shared-ui use Vitest
- API uses Jest

# Task Progress

# Final Review
The task has been completed successfully. We have:
1. Created a task branch and documentation
2. Updated test scripts to remove watch mode
3. Added root-level test command using Turborepo
4. Configured Turborepo pipeline for tests
5. Verified all tests are passing
6. Cleaned up backup files

The project now has:
- Root-level test command: `pnpm test`
- Consistent test behavior across packages
- No automatic watch mode (use `test:watch` where available)
- Proper test dependencies through Turborepo

All tests are passing across all packages:
- API (Jest): 6 tests passed
- Web (Vitest): 4 tests passed
- Shared UI (Vitest): 17 tests passed
