## Task Description
Fix the property filters functionality in the web app to ensure proper filtering of properties based on location type and other criteria.

## Project Overview
The project is a real estate website with a monorepo structure using Turborepo. The web app is built with React + TypeScript, and the API is built with Node.js + Express + Prisma.

## Execution Protocol
1. Create task branch ✅
2. Create task file ✅
3. Analyze task and implementation ✅
4. Iterate on task
5. Complete task
6. Merge to main branch
7. Delete task branch
8. Review

## Task Analysis
After investigating the codebase, I found the following issues:

1. **Location Type Mismatch**:
   - The API schema in Prisma only supported "CITY" and "REGION" as values for `location_type`
   - The web project allows "CITY", "SUBURB", "VILLAGE", "SEASIDE", and "MOUNTAIN"
   - This mismatch was causing the filter functionality to fail

2. **Filter Implementation**:
   - The web app correctly constructs the filter parameters in `Properties.tsx`
   - The `propertyService.ts` correctly appends all filters to the URL params
   - The `usePagination` hook correctly triggers a fetch when filters change
   - The API's property routes handle the filters correctly

3. **Database Schema**:
   - Created a migration to update the `location_type` field to support all values
   - Added a check constraint to ensure valid values
   - Updated existing data to use valid values

## Steps Taken
1. ✅ Created task branch
2. ✅ Created task file
3. ✅ Analyzed codebase for discrepancies
4. ✅ Updated Prisma schema to support all location types
5. ✅ Created and applied migration with check constraint
6. ✅ Fixed test files to use correct string literals
7. ✅ Verified all tests are passing

## Success Criteria
1. ✅ Property filters in the web app work correctly
2. ✅ Location type filter supports all values: "CITY", "SUBURB", "VILLAGE", "SEASIDE", "MOUNTAIN"
3. ✅ All existing data has valid location_type values
4. ✅ Integration tests pass for all location type scenarios
5. ✅ All unit tests pass in apps/api, including:
   - Property route tests
   - Property controller tests
   - Property validation tests
6. ✅ All unit tests pass in apps/web, including:
   - Property component tests
   - Property filter tests
   - Property service tests

## Current Status
✅ Task completed successfully:
- Database schema updated to support all location types
- Migration applied successfully
- Tests updated and passing
- Filter functionality working correctly in the web app

## Next Steps
1. Merge changes to main branch
2. Delete task branch
3. Monitor for any issues in production
